SWRLTab
=======

Provides a standalone version of the old [Protege-OWL SWRLTab](http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SWRLTab) 
that is built on the [OWLAPI-based version of the SWRLAPI](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi.git).

The [SWRLTab Plugin]((https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi-plugin.git) will soon provide a version that is 
integrated with the latest release of [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu).
