SWRLTab
=======

The SWRLTab is a [SWRLAPI](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi/wiki)-based environment that provides a set of standalone graphical interfaces for managing SWRL rules. These interfaces are designed to be embeddable into third party Java applications.

Documentation can be found at the [SWRLTab Wiki](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrltab/wiki).

A [Protege Desktop Ontology Editor](http://protege.stanford.edu)-based [SWRLTab Plugin](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrltab-plugin/wiki) is also available.
